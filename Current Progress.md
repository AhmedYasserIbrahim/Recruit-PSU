# Project Documentation
This document serves as a comprehensive log of the project's progress, highlighting both the challenges encountered and the features being implemented. It will provide insights into the current state of the project as well as serve as a reference for future development.

# Problems 
- Signing in with Google does not create a new user row to the google sheets form. 
- Signing in normally does not create a password for the user, so the user needs to go to the forgot password page to sign in. **(New users are forwarded to the forgot password page to set their password)**.
- Forgot password feature does not work. **(Probably because the website is not published yet)**.
- Not sure whether to make joining the platform for a small fee such as 5$ to help with the cost.
- Need to add the page where users can modify their account information.

# Features 
- Google sign in was added as a feature.
- Confirmed that PSU students would be considered external users, making the pricing of publication feasible.
- Created a page to give the option to sign up as student or as recruiter.
