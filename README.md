# Problem Statement

The continuous growth and expansion of the job market, coupled with increasing competitiveness, has significantly increased the number of students seeking internships during their university studies. According to a study by the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE), in 2022, 67.4% of students with internship experience received at least one job offer, while only 43.7% of students without internship experience received an offer.

However, students at Prince Sultan University currently struggle to find applicable internship opportunities to apply to. Moreover, LinkedIn, a widely-used platform for networking and job search, is becoming increasingly crowded with irrelevant information, making it even more challenging for students to discover opportunities that can provide them with valuable experience and the chance to showcase their skills and network with potential employers.

This problem has a significant impact on the career development and employability of Prince Sultan University students, as they may miss out on valuable opportunities to gain practical experience, build their professional network, and ultimately, secure job offers upon graduation. Addressing this issue is crucial to ensuring that students can effectively navigate the job market and transition from academia to the workforce.

# Solution

To address this problem, we propose to develop Recruit PSU, a comprehensive platform that streamlines the internship and job search process for Prince Sultan University students. The platform will provide students with easy access to a curated list of internship and job opportunities, allowing them to efficiently filter and apply for positions that align with their interests and qualifications.

Recruit PSU will offer the following key features:

1. **Opportunities Page**: Students will be able to browse and explore a wide range of internship and job postings, with detailed information about the position, requirements, and application process.

2. **One-Click Application**: The platform will simplify the application process by enabling students to submit their applications with a single click, reducing the administrative burden and increasing their chances of securing interviews.

3. **Student Profiles**: Recruiters will have access to student profiles, which will include information about their academic achievements, skills, extracurricular activities, and downloadable CVs. This will help recruiters identify and connect with the most suitable candidates.

4. **Communication Tools**: Recruit PSU will facilitate communication between students and recruiters, enabling them to arrange interviews, follow up on applications, and maintain ongoing conversations.

By leveraging these features, Recruit PSU aims to bridge the gap between Prince Sultan University students and employers, providing a seamless platform for internship and job search, and ultimately enhancing the career prospects of our students.
