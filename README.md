# Problem Statement

The continuous growth and expansion of the job market, coupled with increasing competitiveness, has significantly increased the number of students seeking internships during their university studies. According to a study by the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE), in 2022, 67.4% of students with internship experience received at least one job offer, while only 43.7% of students without internship experience received an offer.

However, students at Prince Sultan University currently struggle to find applicable internship opportunities to apply to. Moreover, LinkedIn, a widely-used platform for networking and job search, is becoming increasingly crowded with irrelevant information, making it even more challenging for students to discover opportunities that can provide them with valuable experience and the chance to showcase their skills and network with potential employers.

This problem has a significant impact on the career development and employability of Prince Sultan University students, as they may miss out on valuable opportunities to gain practical experience, build their professional network, and ultimately, secure job offers upon graduation. Addressing this issue is crucial to ensuring that students can effectively navigate the job market and transition from academia to the workforce.

# Solution

To address this problem, we propose to develop Recruit PSU, a comprehensive platform that streamlines the internship and job search process for Prince Sultan University students. The platform will provide students with easy access to a curated list of internship and job opportunities, allowing them to efficiently filter and apply for positions that align with their interests and qualifications.

Recruit PSU will offer the following key features:

1. **Opportunities Page**: Students will be able to browse and explore a wide range of internship and job postings, with detailed information about the position, requirements, and application process.

2. **One-Click Application**: The platform will simplify the application process by enabling students to submit their applications with a single click, reducing the administrative burden and increasing their chances of securing interviews.

3. **Student Profiles**: Recruiters will have access to student profiles, which will include information about their academic achievements, skills, extracurricular activities, and downloadable CVs. This will help recruiters identify and connect with the most suitable candidates.

4. **Communication Tools**: Recruit PSU will facilitate communication between students and recruiters, enabling them to arrange interviews, follow up on applications, and maintain ongoing conversations.

By leveraging these features, Recruit PSU aims to bridge the gap between Prince Sultan University students and employers, providing a seamless platform for internship and job search, and ultimately enhancing the career prospects of our students.


# Market

Recruit PSU aims to fill a significant market need for Prince Sultan University students seeking internship and job opportunities. By integrating the platform with the university's existing systems and databases, we can provide a seamless and streamlined experience for students to access a curated selection of internship and employment prospects.

The implementation of Recruit PSU would be a strategic move for Prince Sultan University, both academically and from a business perspective. As a novel solution in the Saudi Arabian higher education landscape, the platform would give the university a competitive edge and serve as an effective marketing strategy to attract prospective students.

Moreover, the platform's ability to facilitate internship and cooperative (co-op) opportunities would have a direct impact on the employment rates of PSU students. By enabling them to leverage the skills and knowledge gained during their academic studies and apply them in real-world, practical settings, Recruit PSU will enhance the students' contributions to their respective communities and industries.

The integration of Recruit PSU with the university's existing platforms and databases will be a crucial aspect of the project, as it will ensure that the platform is deeply embedded within the institution's ecosystem. This integration will not only provide students with a centralized and efficient access point for finding internships and jobs but also allow the university to better support its students' career development and post-graduation employment outcomes.

Overall, the implementation of Recruit PSU represents a significant opportunity for Prince Sultan University to differentiate itself, improve student outcomes, and contribute to the broader economic and societal development of the region.

# Progress

The Recruit PSU platform is already well under development, thanks to the team's use of the Softr no-code tool which has accelerated the process. Most of the core features have already been implemented, with the exceptions noted in the [issues tab of this repository](https://github.com/AhmedYasserIbrahim/Recruit-PSU/issues).

As documented, there are a few key features still in progress or planned for the future:

1. Automating the process of adding new data, such as student profiles and job postings, to the platform.

2. Allowing students to upload their CVs to the platform.

3. Enabling students to edit their own profile information as needed.

While some premium Softr features are still unavailable, the core functionality of the Recruit PSU platform is largely in place thanks to the no-code development approach. The remaining planned improvements focus on enhancing the user experience for both students and employers. It is also worth mentioning that once the premium subscription is acquired, implementing these features would be feasible within less than a week. Feel free to add any issues to the issue tab of this repository!
